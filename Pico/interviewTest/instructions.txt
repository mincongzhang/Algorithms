Use the program WaveGen.exe (requires .net 2.0) to generate some random waveforms in CSV format. 

In C# or C++, write a windows application that calculates the frequency of the highest amplitude wave in each file. Each wave is of fixed frequency. Output a CSV file containing the waveform filename in the first column and the waveform frequency in the second column. Sort the results by ascending frequency. The task should take approximately 1 hour.

Send us the source to your program (but not the generated waveforms). We will use WaveGen.exe to generate some more random waveforms to test your program.
